After having been a sole practitioner for many years, her dream of opening an acne-only clinic came true in 2005. As a result of her astounding results with acne, other&nbsp;estheticians started demanding classes to learn her protocol. Out of this was born her comprehensive Acne Specialist training and she has certified over 400 skin care professionals, including nurses and doctors, around the United States.&nbsp;</p>",

You will learn how to use products slowly at first, so that your skin stays receptive without causing irritation or dehydration. But skin can become accustomed to products and then become less effective over time &ndash; that is why we will adjust your regimen little by little, to get rid of your acne.</p>",

Acne can really ravage \u0003\t\t    the skin of teenage boys – the hormonal fluctuations that teenage boys have can give them horrendous cysts and often they end up with lifelong scars because of it. We started off using the strongest antibacterials we had to get his inflammation under control in the quickest manner possible. We wanted to get the inflammation down as soon as possible to avoid the scarring that could happen if it was left unchecked. His acne cleared up in four month’s time and he was left with minimal scarring. Francisco and his father drove 1.5 hours (one way) to get to our clinic.",
              "testimonial": "I have tried Proactiv and antibiotics and none of them seemed to work to clear my skin. My experience at Face Reality was great! My face started to clear fast after I started coming to the clinic. Yes, the results totally met my expectations and ever since my face has started to clear up, I have been getting noticed by everyone. I recommend Face Reality for people with acne; and for them to come to Face Reality Acne & Skin Care Clinic. It will change your perspective in life.",
